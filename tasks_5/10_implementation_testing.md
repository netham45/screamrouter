# Task 10: `AudioProcessor` - Implementation and Testing Strategy

**Objective:**
Outline a strategy for implementing the refactoring changes and testing them to ensure correctness and preservation of functionality.

**Implementation Strategy:**

1.  **Branching:** Create a new Git branch for this refactoring task to isolate changes.
2.  **Incremental Changes:** Implement the tasks one by one, or in small logical groups. Compile frequently to catch errors early.
    *   Start with foundational changes like constants and member renaming (Task 5).
    *   Implement the `AudioProcessorConfig` and update the constructor (Task 2).
    *   Address memory management for Biquad filters and sampler states (Task 4).
    *   Convert internal buffers to `std::vector` and implement pre-allocation (Task 6).
    *   Update logging (Task 3).
    *   Consolidate files (Task 7).
    *   Refactor the `isProcessingRequired` cache (Task 8).
    *   Continuously update `audio_processor.h` as changes are made, culminating in a final review (Task 9).
3.  **Update Call Sites:** As the `AudioProcessor` interface changes (e.g., constructor, method signatures due to member renames), update the instantiation and usage sites in `SourceInputProcessor.cpp` and `SinkAudioMixer.cpp`.
4.  **Build System:** If `speaker_mix.cpp` is deleted, remove it from the build system (e.g., Makefile, CMakeLists.txt).

**Testing Strategy:**

1.  **Compilation:** The primary initial test is successful compilation after each incremental change.
2.  **Existing Unit Tests (if any):**
    *   If there are existing unit tests for `AudioProcessor` or components that use it, ensure they continue to pass.
    *   Update tests if interfaces have changed but underlying logic should yield the same results.
3.  **Functional Testing (Manual/Integration):**
    *   Since the core audio algorithms are unchanged, the primary goal is to verify that the refactored `AudioProcessor` integrates correctly and produces the same audio output as before.
    *   **Reference Output:** If possible, capture output from the system *before* refactoring with known input signals (e.g., sine waves, specific audio files) and various processing settings (volume, EQ, channel mixing).
    *   **Comparison:** After refactoring, run the same tests and compare the output. This could involve:
        *   Listening tests (subjective).
        *   Signal analysis (e.g., comparing waveforms, spectral content if tools are available).
        *   Bit-for-bit comparison if the output format is PCM and all processing is deterministic.
    *   Test various scenarios:
        *   Different input/output channel counts.
        *   Different input/output sample rates.
        *   Various volume levels.
        *   Different EQ settings (flat, and with various bands adjusted).
        *   Scenarios where `isProcessingRequired()` would be true and false.
4.  **Memory Leak Detection:**
    *   Use tools like Valgrind (on Linux/macOS) or similar memory debuggers on Windows during testing to ensure the new `std::unique_ptr` usage correctly manages memory and no leaks are introduced.
5.  **Performance Profiling (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   If performance is critical, profile the `processAudio` method before and after refactoring to ensure no significant regressions are introduced. The move to pre-allocated `std::vector` and `std::unique_ptr` should generally have neutral or positive performance impact compared to raw arrays and manual memory management, but verification is good.
6.  **Logging Verification:**
    *   Check that new log messages are appearing as expected, with correct context IDs, and that old `std::cout` messages are gone.

**Rollback Plan:**
*   If significant issues arise that cannot be easily resolved, revert to the pre-refactoring state using Git.

**Acceptance Criteria for Overall Refactor:**

*   All individual tasks (01-09) are completed.
*   The application compiles and runs without new crashes or errors.
*   Audio output quality and behavior are identical to the pre-refactoring version under various test conditions.
*   Memory usage is stable, and no new memory leaks are detected.
*   Logging is improved and standardized.
*   The codebase for `AudioProcessor` is cleaner, more maintainable, and adheres to modern C++ practices.
