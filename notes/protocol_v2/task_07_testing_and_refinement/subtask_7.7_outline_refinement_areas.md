# Sub-Task 7.7: Outline Areas for Refinement Post-Implementation

**Objective:** Identify and document key areas for refinement and enhancement after the initial implementation and testing of Protocol v2 features. This serves as a roadmap for future improvements.

**Parent Task:** [Protocol v2 Testing and Refinement Strategy](../task_07_testing_and_refinement.md)
**Previous Sub-Task:** [Sub-Task 7.6: Test Plan for Stress and Stability](./subtask_7.6_testplan_stress_stability.md)

## Key Refinement Areas:

1.  **SDP Offer/Answer Model Robustness:**
    *   **Current State:** Basic SDP parsing and generation for essential parameters.
    *   **Refinement:**
        *   More comprehensive SDP parsing to handle a wider range of attributes and formats from diverse clients.
        *   More sophisticated SDP generation by ScreamRouter, potentially including more media attributes, bandwidth information, or support for more codecs.
        *   Full compliance with SDP standards (RFC 4566 and related RFCs).
        *   Better handling of SDP negotiation failures or unsupported media formats.
        *   Dynamic payload type negotiation and management based on full SDP offer/answer.

2.  **RTP Payload Format for Scream Data (If Custom Format Used):**
    *   **Current State (Hypothetical):** May use a default RTP payload for PCM, or potentially prepend the 5-byte Scream header to the RTP payload for custom handling.
    *   **Refinement:**
        *   If a custom format (Scream header in RTP payload) is used, ensure it's clearly documented for third-party client developers.
        *   Evaluate if standard RTP payload formats for PCM (e.g., L16 as per RFC 3551) are sufficient and if the 5-byte header info can be fully conveyed via SDP, eliminating the need for a custom RTP payload structure. This improves interoperability.
        *   For MP3, ensure compliance with RFC 2250 or a similar standard for RTP payload format for MPEG audio.

3.  **Error Handling and Logging:**
    *   **Current State:** Basic error logging implemented across new modules.
    *   **Refinement:**
        *   More granular error codes or messages for easier diagnosis of issues in SIP, RTP, and WebRTC stacks.
        *   User-facing error messages in the UI that are more informative than generic "failed" messages.
        *   Structured logging (e.g., JSON logs) for easier parsing and analysis by log management tools.
        *   Correlation IDs to trace a single session or request across different logs (Python, C++, client).

4.  **Security Enhancements (Major Area):**
    *   **Current State:** Basic functionality, likely unencrypted.
    *   **Refinement (SIP):**
        *   Implement TLS for SIP signaling transport (`sips:` URI, `transport=tls`). Requires OpenSSL/TLS support in PJSIP and certificate management.
        *   Implement SIP Digest authentication for `REGISTER` requests to secure device registration.
    *   **Refinement (RTP):**
        *   Implement SRTP (Secure RTP) for encrypted media streams.
        *   Key exchange mechanisms: SDES (Session Description Protocol Security Descriptions for Media Streams - RFC 4568) or DTLS-SRTP. This requires integration with OpenSSL in the C++ RTP handling.
    *   **Refinement (WebRTC):** WebRTC is inherently secure (DTLS-SRTP), but ensure underlying libraries (libdatachannel, OpenSSL) are kept up-to-date with security patches.
    *   **Refinement (General):** Review for potential denial-of-service vulnerabilities (e.g., resource exhaustion from malformed packets or excessive requests).

5.  **Advanced RTP/RTCP Features:**
    *   **Current State:** Basic RTP sending/receiving. RTCP might be handled minimally by oRTP.
    *   **Refinement:**
        *   Full RTCP implementation for quality of service (QoS) feedback (Sender Reports, Receiver Reports, jitter, packet loss).
        *   Use RTCP feedback to adapt streaming parameters (e.g., bitrate for MP3 if variable, though LAME typically encodes CBR/ABR).
        *   More sophisticated jitter buffer implementation in `RtpReceiver` if oRTP's default is insufficient for certain network conditions.
        *   Support for RTP header extensions if needed for specific metadata.

6.  **WebRTC Signaling Robustness and Features:**
    *   **Current State:** Basic SDP offer/answer and ICE candidate relay.
    *   **Refinement:**
        *   More robust handling of ICE restart scenarios.
        *   Support for trickle ICE (sending candidates as they are discovered rather than all at once). `libdatachannel` likely supports this; ensure signaling bridge handles it.
        *   Better error recovery for WebRTC connection failures.
        *   Consider support for multiple data channels if future features require it.

7.  **Performance Optimization:**
    *   **Current State:** Focus on functionality.
    *   **Refinement:**
        *   Profile C++ audio engine (especially RTP/WebRTC packet processing, encoding/decoding paths) under load and identify bottlenecks.
        *   Optimize memory allocations (e.g., object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects like `TaggedAudioPacket` or `mblk_t` if not fully managed by libraries).
        *   Optimize Python code in `SipManager` and `ConfigurationManager` if they become bottlenecks under high SIP load.
        *   Review threading models for efficiency and potential contention.

8.  **User Experience (UI/UX) for Advanced Configurations:**
    *   **Current State:** Basic UI elements for new protocol settings.
    *   **Refinement:**
        *   More intuitive presentation of complex settings (e.g., codec preferences, SRTP keys).
        *   Better visual feedback for device status (online, offline, connecting, error).
        *   Tooltips, help texts, and links to documentation for advanced options.
        *   Wizard-style setup for new devices with complex protocols.

9.  **Code Quality and Maintainability:**
    *   **Refinement:**
        *   Increase unit test coverage for new Python and C++ modules.
        *   Refactor code for clarity and adherence to coding standards.
        *   Update all developer documentation and code comments.

10. **Documentation Updates:**
    *   **Current State:** Initial documentation for new features.
    *   **Refinement:**
        *   Comprehensive user guides for configuring and using RTP, WebRTC, and SIP devices with ScreamRouter.
        *   Detailed developer documentation for the new C++ classes, Python modules, and APIs.
        *   Update `protocol_spec_v2.md` with any deviations or clarifications found during implementation and refinement.

This list provides a starting point for ongoing improvement after the core Protocol v2 features are functional. Prioritization will depend on user feedback and project goals.
