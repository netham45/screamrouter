# Sub-Task 7.8: Update Documentation Based on Testing and Refinements

**Objective:** Update all relevant project documentation (`protocol_spec_v2.md`, user guides, developer notes) to reflect any changes, clarifications, or finalized details that arose during the implementation and testing of Protocol v2 features.

**Parent Task:** [Protocol v2 Testing and Refinement Strategy](../task_07_testing_and_refinement.md)
**Previous Sub-Task:** [Sub-Task 7.7: Outline Areas for Refinement Post-Implementation](./subtask_7.7_outline_refinement_areas.md)

## Key Documentation to Update:

1.  **`notes/protocol_v2/protocol_spec_v2.md` (Primary Specification Document):**
    *   **Review Each Section:** Go through every section of the spec and compare it against the actual implementation.
    *   **Zeroconf (Section 2):**
        *   Confirm the exact service type (e.g., `_screamrouter-sip._udp.local.`).
        *   Verify all TXT record keys and example values.
    *   **Session Negotiation & Management (SIP/SDP - Section 3):**
        *   Clarify `REGISTER` handling, especially parsing of UUID and SDP.
        *   Detail the keep-alive mechanism (e.g., specific interval for OPTIONS or re-REGISTERs, timeout values).
        *   Refine SDP examples for RTP sources/sinks and WebRTC clients to match what ScreamRouter expects and generates.
        *   Ensure custom SDP attributes (`a=x-screamrouter-role`, `a=x-screamrouter-uuid`) are accurately documented.
    *   **Audio Transport (RTP, WebRTC, Legacy - Section 4):**
        *   **RTP:**
            *   Specify exact payload types used for PCM and MP3 if defaults are hardcoded or how dynamic assignment works with SDP.
            *   Document RTP timestamp clock rates used for different audio formats.
            *   Clarify marker bit usage for PCM and MP3.
            *   Detail endianness for PCM payload if not standard network byte order.
        *   **WebRTC:** Confirm MP3 streaming over data channels is the primary method.
        *   **Legacy Scream:** Ensure the 5-byte header description is still accurate.
    *   **Audio Format Handling (Section 5):**
        *   List all supported sample rates, bit depths, and channel counts accurately.
    *   **Configuration Data Model Changes (Section 6):**
        *   Ensure Pydantic model field descriptions in the spec match the final implementation in `src/screamrouter_types/configuration.py`.
        *   Clarify the meaning and usage of `protocol_type: "sip"`.
    *   **Security Considerations (Section 7):** Update with any implemented security measures or more concrete plans for future security work.
    *   **Appendix A: Example SDP:** Update example SDPs to be fully consistent with what the system produces or expects.

2.  **User-Facing Documentation (`README.md`, Wiki, Site Docs):**
    *   **Installation/Setup:**
        *   Update prerequisites, especially for `pjproject` C libraries and any other new system dependencies (CMake, build tools for oRTP/libdatachannel if users build from source).
    *   **Configuration Guide:**
        *   Explain how to configure new source/sink types (RTP, WebRTC, SIP-managed).
        *   Detail new UI elements in settings modals/pages.
        *   Explain new fields in `config.yaml` (e.g., `protocol_type`, `rtp_config`, `webrtc_config`, `uuid`, `sip_contact_uri`).
        *   Provide examples for configuring RTP and WebRTC devices.
    *   **Troubleshooting:**
        *   Add common issues and solutions related to new protocols (e.g., SIP registration failures, RTP/WebRTC connection problems, mDNS discovery issues, firewall considerations).
    *   **New "SIP Registered Devices" Page:** Explain its purpose and how to use it.

3.  **Developer Documentation (Code Comments, Internal Docs):**
    *   Ensure code comments in C++ and Python for new classes and complex functions are clear, up-to-date, and explain the "why" as well as the "what."
    *   Update any internal design documents or developer notes that were created during the Protocol v2 development process.
    *   Document the signaling flow for WebRTC (Python <-> C++ bridge) in detail.
    *   Clarify the build process in `setup.py` with comments, especially the custom build command for dependencies.

## Process:

1.  **Gather Feedback:** Collect notes, issues, and clarifications identified during all previous testing sub-tasks (7.1 to 7.6).
2.  **Review Implementation:** Compare the final implemented code against the existing documentation.
3.  **Update Systematically:** Go through each documentation source and update relevant sections.
4.  **Peer Review (Recommended):** Have another developer review the documentation changes for clarity, accuracy, and completeness.
5.  **Version Control:** Commit documentation updates along with related code changes.

## Acceptance Criteria:

*   `protocol_spec_v2.md` accurately reflects the final implementation of Protocol v2.
*   User documentation (README, guides) is updated to cover new features, configuration options, and troubleshooting for Protocol v2.
*   Developer documentation (code comments, internal notes) is updated and provides sufficient clarity on new components and logic.
*   All documented examples (SDP, configuration snippets) are correct and tested.
